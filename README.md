# Sentiment Analysis 140 Datasets with 1.6 million tweets

This project analyzes the Sentiment140 dataset, which contains 1.6 million labeled tweets for sentiment analysis. It demonstrates preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning techniques to predict tweet sentiments.

---

## Features of the Dataset
- **Data Source**: Sentiment140 dataset with 1.6 million tweets.
- **Columns**:
  - `polarity`: Sentiment label (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive).
  - `id`: Unique ID of the tweet.
  - `date`: The date and time of the tweet.
  - `query`: The query keyword used to gather the tweet.
  - `user`: Username of the account that posted the tweet.
  - `text`: The actual tweet content.

---

## Project Overview
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization and stopword removal.
   - Cleaning and normalization of tweet text (removal of URLs, mentions, special characters, etc.).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Sentiment distribution in the dataset.
   - Word cloud and frequency visualization for insights.

3. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or other classifiers to predict sentiment.
   - Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following packages are installed:
- `numpy
- `pandas
- `matplotlib
- `seaborn
- `nltk
- `scikit-learn

Install all required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Ensure the dataset (`training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv`) is uploaded or accessible.
3. Execute the cells sequentially for data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
